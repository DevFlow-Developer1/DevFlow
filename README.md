# DevFlow
A Dev Flow for Google App script. Starter templates, a label scheme, the presentation with many links for reading further, a list of what to install and what it might cost you.

This repo will be used to demonstrate the described 'development work flow' for creating and maintaining google app script. It will be updated over time to demonstrate various best practices and general demonstrations; some inspired by topics covered in the Totally Unscripted series and posts in the over 20,000 member strong
[G+ Google Apps Script Community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102471985047225101769) and others by my own private projects.
